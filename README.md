- [hardbyte/python-can](https://github.com/hardbyte/python-can) - Alongside a [PCAN-USB](https://www.peak-system.com/PCAN-USB.199.0.html?L=1) (physical bus) or [SocketCAN](https://docs.kernel.org/networking/can.html) alone (virtual bus), I use this package to send, recieve and log [CAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus) messages.
- [j-c-cook/cross-compile-python.md](https://gist.github.com/j-c-cook/2a291dc0bfaa2f6639272e344ff66e62) - Includes an outline for how to cross compile the Python language (the [cpython](https://github.com/python/cpython) implementation) for use on an obscure processor (armv7l). After cross-compiling, I was able to utilize `python-can`'s `SizedRolloverLogging` functionality on a remote device.
