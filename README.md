<details><summary>Controller Area Network bus</summary>

- [hardbyte/python-can](https://github.com/hardbyte/python-can) - has enabled CAN logging of signals communicated over CAN buses, along with data engineering by parsing recoded logs. 
- [j-c-cook/cross-compile-python.md](https://gist.github.com/j-c-cook/2a291dc0bfaa2f6639272e344ff66e62) - [cpython](https://github.com/python/cpython) was cross-compiled to enable usage of `python-can` on an armv7l chip archetecture.

<details><summary>Ground heat exchangers</summary>

- [pygfunction](https://github.com/MassimoCimmino/pygfunction) served as the backbone for a first of kind ground heat exchanger design tool, [ghedt](https://github.com/j-c-cook/ghedt). 
- [cpgfunctionEP](https://github.com/j-c-cook/cpgfunctionEP) has been integrated into [EnergyPlus](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus) as a third party application.
- [cpgfunction](https://github.com/j-c-cook/cpgfunction) was used to compute g-functions on a high performance computing cluster (HPCC).
